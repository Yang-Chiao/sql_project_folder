# Background  

This project is based on a course designed by Luke Barousse, which uses real-world scenarios to help develop both SQL skills and logical thinking.  

To guide my analysis, I focused on answering the following questions through SQL queries:  
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?  
2. What skills are required for these top-paying roles?  
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?  
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?  
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

These questions helped shape the direction of the project and provided valuable insights into the data analytics job market.




# Tools I Used  

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I leveraged several essential tools:

- **SQL**  
  The backbone of my analysis, used to query the database and extract key insights.

- **PostgreSQL**  
  A powerful and reliable database management system, perfect for working with large sets of job posting data.

- **Visual Studio Code**  
  My preferred code editor for writing and executing SQL queries, as well as managing the project structure.

- **Git & GitHub**  
  Used for version control and collaboration. Git helped track changes, while GitHub made it easy to share scripts and maintain the project.

# What I Learned  

Through this project, I significantly improved my SQL skills by working with real-world datasets and writing practical, goal-driven queries. I learned how to join tables, filter data, perform aggregations, and rank results to uncover meaningful insights.  

In addition to technical SQL knowledge, I also developed stronger logical thinking skills. Crafting queries to answer complex questions required me to think critically, break down problems into smaller parts, and build solutions step by step.  

This hands-on experience has not only deepened my understanding of data analysis but also made me more confident in approaching real data challenges.
